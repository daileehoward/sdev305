        <h2>A Little Bit About Me!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello there!<br>
            My name is Dailee Howard and I'm an IT Software Development Student at Green River College.<br>
            You can explore some of my programming projects and resources here!<br>
            I'm on the lookout for new employment opportunities, with a focus in databases and back-end work,<br>
            so please keep me in mind.
        </p>

        <h5>My Past...</h5>
        <p>
            I would definitely say that I come from a non-tech background. I was born and raised in Renton Washington
            with my mother, father, and brother. Growing up, I developed my love of animals, music, and helping others.
            When it came time to start deciding what I wanted to do in life, I went from wanting to be a lawyer, to a
            cancer researcher, to a music therapist. I started taking all kinds of courses at Green River to help me
            finally decide what I actually wanted to be. I ended up concentrating in accounting, and although I was
            good with numbers, they didn't leave me coming back for more...
        </p>

        <h5>My Present...</h5>
        <p>
            Shortly after, I took the plunge and enrolled in a 3-credit "Intro to Python" course, to which I swore it
            would be the last subject I try. To my amazement, I found something that I was not only good at, but
            something I actually enjoyed working with. Ever since then, I was accepted into the bachelor's program in
            Cohort 12 and am getting some real-world experience with coding. On top of that, I'm thankful for being able
            work as an IT Student Help Desk Employee for the college. When I find time away from the keyboard, I like to
            go horseback riding, off-roading, camping, and pick up a good mystery-themed book...
        </p>

        <h5>My Future...</h5>
        <p>
            As I'm progressing through the bachelor's program, I hope to narrow down exactly which area of software I
            want to pursue for the future. Like my classmates, I'm working towards obtaining an internship for the summer
            (2020) that would hopefully get my foot-in-the-door to a full-time career by the time of graduation
            (if not sooner)! Eventually, I'd like to look into doing more remote-work, which this past year has prepped
            me quite well for...
